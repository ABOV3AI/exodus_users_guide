# ABOV3 FlowCore - Visual Workflow Builder

## Overview

FlowCore is a native visual workflow automation builder integrated into ABOV3 Exodus. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for creating, managing, and executing automated workflows - similar to n8n or Zapier, but built directly into Exodus.

## Features

### ✅ Completed

**Phase 1 - Core Builder (MVP)**
- **Multi-Workflow Management**: Create and manage unlimited workflows
- **Drag-and-Drop Canvas**: Visual node-based workflow editor powered by React Flow
- **Node Palette**: Pre-built node types for tools, AI, logic, triggers, and outputs
- **Workflow List**: Left sidebar with search, filtering, and workflow selection
- **Properties Panel**: Configure selected nodes with dynamic forms
- **Workflow Toolbar**: Run, save, edit, and manage workflows
- **Persistent Storage**: IndexedDB-backed storage via Zustand persist middleware
- **Navigation Integration**: FlowCore icon (🔀) in left sidebar below Call button
- **Full-Screen Builder**: Dedicated `/flowcore` route with full-page interface

**Phase 2 - Execution Engine**
- **Workflow Executor**: Graph-based execution engine with sequential node processing
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live execution viewer showing current node and progress
- **Visual Highlighting**: Canvas nodes highlight during execution (blue=current, green=completed, red=error)
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 retries: 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- **Execution History**: View past workflow runs with timing, results, and errors
- **Execution Context**: Track variables, node results, and errors throughout execution

**Phase 3 - Scheduling & Templates**
- **Cron Scheduler**: Schedule workflows with cron expressions (e.g., '0 9 * * *' = 9am daily)
- **Schedule Presets**: Common schedules (every minute, hourly, daily, weekly, custom)
- **Webhook Triggers**: HTTP endpoint to trigger workflows remotely via POST
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built workflow templates (News Summary, Data Pipeline, Website Monitor, Content Generator)
- **Template Categories**: Browse templates by All/Research/Data/Monitoring/Content
- **Import/Export**: JSON-based workflow import/export with copy and download
- **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Enable/disable workflows without deletion

**Phase 4 - Integration**
- **Enhanced Store**: Zustand store with execution tracking and scheduler integration
- **Scheduler Lifecycle**: Auto-initialize on app startup, cleanup on unmount
- **Execution Persistence**: Workflow runs saved to history (keeps last 50)
- **Template Instantiation**: One-click template usage with auto-import

2. Paste JSON or upload a `.flowcore.json` file
3. Click **"Import"** - workflow appears in your list

### View Execution History

1. Open a workflow
2. Click **"More" menu → "Execution History"**
3. See all past runs with:
   - Status (completed/failed/running)
   - Timing and duration
   - Results and errors
   - Full execution details
